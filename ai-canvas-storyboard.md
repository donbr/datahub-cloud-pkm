# AI Canvas Storyboard

---

## Scene 1: **User Lands on the AI Canvas**

**Visual Cues from Your Images:**

- **Wide scenic view** of a fictional or historical cityscape set against dramatic mountains.  
- Subtle UI overlay with text like: *“Select any part of this image you’re curious about.”*  
- The interface is minimal, focusing on the central image with faint tool icons around the edges.

**Storyboard Narrative:**

1. **Establishing Shot:**  
   - The user opens AI Canvas and is immediately greeted by a rich, detailed image of a grand architectural scene (as seen in your first screenshot).  
   - A gentle tooltip near the center invites them to explore:  
     *“Select any part of this image you’re curious about.”*  

2. **Minimal Interface:**  
   - The only other visible elements are a small header or logo and a faint side panel with a few icons (e.g., for toggling chat or selecting a tool).  
   - This mirrors the notion of letting the image speak for itself while gently guiding the user to interact.

**User’s Emotional State:**  
- Curiosity and a sense of wonder—there’s a vibrant, almost cinematic environment.  
- They see the potential for conversation with the scene but haven’t interacted yet.

## Scene 2: **Initiating Interaction**

**Visual Cues from Your Images:**

- A close-up of the same environment with UI elements overlaying the scene.  
- Text prompts like: *“What’s the story behind these mountains?”* or *“How old is this building?”* appear near a selected region.

**Storyboard Narrative:**

1. **Cursor Movement & Subtle Highlights:**  
   - As the user moves their cursor (or finger on a touchscreen) across the image, faint highlights appear around interesting features—e.g., the dome of a building, mountain peaks in the background.  
   - This is reflected in your images where a translucent box or shape might highlight a portion of the city.

2. **First Selection:**  
   - The user clicks or taps on a region (perhaps the tall, ornate building).  
   - A gentle glow outlines the selected area, as shown in your visuals—possibly a semi-transparent overlay.  
   - Immediately, a small prompt near that region offers suggested questions:  
     *“What’s the story behind these mountains?”*  
     *“How old is this building?”*  
     *“What does the landscape symbolize?”*

**User’s Emotional State:**  
- They feel a sense of agency, seeing that the AI Canvas is reacting to exactly where they clicked.  
- The environment feels alive and open to exploration.

## Scene 3: **Asking the First Question**

**Visual Cues from Your Images:**

- A chat bubble or minimal text box near the region, or in a side panel, reading: *“This area appears to be a mountain range with snow-capped peaks…”*  
- Additional UI elements might say *“Explore 3D,”* *“Generate Variations,”* or show a small speaker icon for voice input.

**Storyboard Narrative:**

1. **Prompt & AI Response:**  
   - The user either types their own question or clicks one of the suggested prompts.  
   - A quick “thinking” animation or progress indicator displays (some of your screenshots show a small loading ring or typed-out text effect).  
   - The AI responds with a short, insightful explanation:  
     *“This area appears to be a mountain range… These mountains have historical significance, possibly referencing an ancient civilization…”*

2. **Additional Suggestions & Buttons:**  
   - Beside or beneath the answer, buttons appear:
     - **Explore 3D**: Switch to a 3D extrusion or depth-based view of the region.  
     - **Generate Variations**: Create stylized transformations or alternative versions of the scene.  
     - A small voice icon, hinting that the user can also speak their queries.

**User’s Emotional State:**  
- Awe at seeing immediate, relevant information about the selected region.  
- Encouraged to keep exploring more advanced features.

## Scene 4: **Exploring Follow-Up Features**

**Visual Cues from Your Images:**

- Some screenshots depict a toggle or slider for 3D or Variation generation.  
- Others show a voice input button or an expanded side panel for more advanced interactions.

**Storyboard Narrative:**

1. **3D or Variation Mode:**  
   - Intrigued by the AI’s response, the user clicks “Explore 3D.”  
   - The interface transitions smoothly, revealing a depth-based view of the city or mountains.  
   - A short “celebratory” message: *“You’ve unlocked 3D Exploration!”* or a subtle animation that highlights the new perspective.

2. **Visual Confirmation & Next Steps:**  
   - The user sees a 3D or alternate-stylized version of the scene.  
   - The system might prompt:  
     *“Try asking about the architectural style in 3D”*  
     or  
     *“Generate variations in a futuristic theme.”*

**User’s Emotional State:**  
- Delight at seeing how easy it is to pivot from Q&A to more creative or exploratory modes.  
- They realize that the entire scene is at their fingertips for in-depth discovery.

## Scene 5: **Broadening Interaction (Voice, Variation, More Regions)**

**Visual Cues from Your Images:**

- Possibly a final screenshot showing the user’s avatar or a representation of voice input (like a wave or mic icon) with a partially transformed or reimagined scene in the background.

**Storyboard Narrative:**

1. **Voice Query Introduction:**  
   - A small tooltip or highlight on the mic icon:  
     *“You can also ask by voice—try saying, ‘What’s the historical context of this temple?’”*  
   - The user clicks or taps the mic, sees a quick audio waveform effect, and asks their question aloud.

2. **Creative Variation Prompt:**  
   - Next, the user is shown how to generate an entirely different style of the same scene:  
     *“Transform this city into a futuristic metropolis.”*  
   - The system produces a set of alternative images, perhaps displayed in a carousel or side panel.

3. **Looping Back to Region Selection:**  
   - The user can once again highlight any part of these new images, continuing the conversation in a fluid, cyclical manner.

**User’s Emotional State:**  
- By now, they’re fully engaged and see the vast potential of AI Canvas.  
- They feel confident exploring advanced features and discovering new ways to interact with visuals.

## Closing Thoughts

- **Immediate Contextual Engagement:** Your images visually reinforce the story of a user stepping into a lush, detailed scene and being guided to ask about specific regions.  
- **Seamless Transitions:** Each step in the storyboard leverages the overlays and UI prompts shown in the images—keeping the interface minimal but contextually rich.  
- **Progressive Discovery:** The screenshots highlight advanced modes (3D, Variation) only after the user’s initial Q&A success, mirroring the progressive onboarding approach.

By weaving these visuals into the onboarding flow, you create a cinematic, interactive feel that shows off AI Canvas’s unique “conversational visual intelligence.” If you’d like, we can further refine any scene or detail how to implement these UI elements technically (e.g., overlay positions, transitions, or voice wave animations).
